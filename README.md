# Steam Score Calculator

### JavaScript application for calculating steam achievement score

## Usage

Insert a Steam user's custom URL, and the application returns that user's game list.  
Application then calculates the user's "Steam Score" according to the following formula:  

Attained achievements score 100 base points for the user. This value is then divided by the achievement's rarity percentage.  
For an example, an achievement which has been attained by 5% of the game's players, scores 100pts / 5 = 20pts.

Application makes API calls for each achievement of each game in the user's library, and returns an accumulated score value of these games.

The player must have set up their custom URL for the search function to work.  
Custom URL can be set up [here](http://steamcommunity.com/my/edit/) in profile settings.  
Profile must also have it's privacy settings set to public.
